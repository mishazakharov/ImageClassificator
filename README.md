# Image Classifier

<h2>About</h2>

This project is an image classifier that is trained to distinguish between cats and dogs in images.

The purpose of this project is not to produce as optimized and computationally effective classifer as possible.
The main goal of the project is to get some expirience in building classifier and writing deep learning related Python code.

    * This file contains the main code for image preprocessing and neural network construction-learning. 
    You can train a neural network on your own or use an existing version, the accuracy of which exceeds 91%!
    * I used feature extraction (transfer learning) from MobileNetV2!
